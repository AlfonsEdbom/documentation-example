# Another Feature

Here is another feature with lots of important documentation

## Table of primes

| No.  |  Prime |
| ---- | ------ |
| 1    |  No    |
| 2    |  Yes   |
| 3    |  Yes   |
| 4    |  No    |


## Code blocks

The following is a Python code block:
```python
  def hello():
      print("Hello world")
```

And this is a C code block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

## Importing own code

```{literalinclude} example.py
:language: python
:emphasize-lines: 2-3
```

## Math equations
This creates an equation:
```{math}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```

This is an in-line equation, {math}`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`, embedded in text.
